#  Heart Disease Prediction

##  Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of a person having **heart disease** based on medical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health indicators.  
Using **machine learning algorithms**, the model provides an early warning system to support healthcare decision-making.

##  Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning with **Pandas & NumPy**  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with **Matplotlib & Seaborn**  
- Classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Visualization of results for better insights  

##  Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

  
##  Workflow
1. Load and preprocess the heart disease dataset  
2. Perform EDA to understand data distribution  
3. Train classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)  
4. Evaluate models using performance metrics  
5. Predict the risk of heart disease for new data  

##  Results
- Logistic Regression showed good interpretability, while Random Forest improved accuracy  

## Future Improvements
- Implement deep learning models for improved predictions  
- Deploy as a **web app** using Flask/Streamlit for real-time predictions  
- Expand dataset for higher generalization
